# Dypocrypha

> A blend of **forbidden texts** and **miscellany** â€” a personal lab disguised as a blog.

---

## Overview
Dypocrypha is a personal space for writing, tinkering, and experimenting.  
It may start as a blog, but the scope will expand into **AI integrations**, **technical explorations**, and **random projects**.  
Think of it as a digital notebook where half-finished ideas and strange prototypes coexist.

---

## What to Expect
- Blog posts (mostly Markdown-based)  
- AI-driven features (chat, summarization, translation, etc.)  
- Experimental playgrounds for side projects  
- Archives of notes, drafts, and curiosities  
- Search, tags, and lightweight organization  

---

## Philosophy
- **Miscellany**: no boundaries on what belongs here  
- **Forbidden**: value in things not usually shared  
- **Process over product**: documentation of attempts, not just polished outcomes  

---

## Road Ahead
No fixed tech stack, no strict roadmap.  
This project will evolve organically, shaped by curiosity and experimentation.
